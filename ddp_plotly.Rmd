Here is a boxplot of the 21st-day-weights of 50 chicks separated into 4 groups with different diets. The data was taken from the ChickWeight dataset in R.
```{r plotly}
x <- list( title = "Diet")
y <- list(title = "Chick Weight (gm)")
plot_ly(ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Time == 21, ], y = ~weight, color = ~Diet, type = "box") %>% layout(title = "Chick Weights on 21st Day of 4 Different Diets", xaxis = x, yaxis = y, showlegend = FALSE)
```
